Fun-Scripts
Just some fun simulations/challenges/puzzles/recreational programming problems
(See each program for details of the puzzle/problem)

Antiprimes
This calculates Antiprimes (number with the maximum number of factors)

Collatz Conjecture
This finds the steps for each number for the Collatz conjecture.
This uses dynamic programming as well.

Frog puzzle
This is a simulation to find the expected number of steps a frog would take to cross a lake.

Hangman
Classic game of hangman using a dictionary.txt file

Impossible Squares
This is a problem to find out if a number can be written as a sum of squares
and hence a square of that area can be drawn on grid of dots.
(See Numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyVl-tcB8pI)

Monty Hall Problem
This is a simulation to show the famous Monty Hall problem and that switching is better than sticking with your original choice.

Number System
This is a program to find the number names for each number and finding a chain
using the number of letters and showing that 4 is a fixed point.

Prisoner Box Puzzle
This is a classic puzzle of prisoners to find their own number and using the best strategy.

Rock Paper Scissors game
Simulated games of rock paper Scissors to find the probabilities of win, loss and draw.

Scraper
This uses web scraping to find the current sensex value at the time.

Stopping problem
This is a classic problem of finding the optimal stopping point to find the best possible toilet (in this case).

19 Challenge
This is a maths pizzle by Matt Parker to find a number that satisfies a certain property.

Yahtzee
This is a simulation of the classic game of Yahtzee where one rolls 5 dice and this program simulates the number of rolls it would take to roll a Yahtzee (all dice give same number)
